# Exponential Smoothing to Analyze End of Summer Trends

## Objective
This task aims to utilize 20 years of daily high-temperature data for Atlanta from July through October to ascertain whether the unofficial end of summer has extended over the years. Exponential smoothing models are employed for this analysis.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: `temps.txt`
- **Statistical Models**: Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters or `es` function from the `smooth` package)
- **Programming Language**: R

## Packages and Libraries Used
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation
- `tidyverse`: For an integrated approach to data manipulation and visualization
- `dslabs`: For access to interesting, real-world data sets
- `data.table`: For fast data manipulation
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization
- `plotly`: For interactive plots
- `outliers`: For outlier detection and analysis
- `qcc`: For quality control, used in CUSUM techniques
