# Advanced Regression Models for Crime Data

## Objective
This task focuses on building various types of regression models to predict the crime rates based on various features. The models used include Stepwise Regression, Lasso, and Elastic Net.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: `uscrime.txt`
- **Statistical Models**: Stepwise Regression, Lasso, Elastic Net
- **Programming Language**: R

## Packages and Libraries Used

### Common Libraries
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation
- `tidyverse`: For an integrated approach to data manipulation and visualization
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization
- `data.table`: For fast data manipulation

### Specific Libraries
- `glmnet`: For Lasso and Elastic Net regression
- `rsample`: For data sampling and resampling
