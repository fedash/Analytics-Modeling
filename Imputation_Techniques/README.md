# Breast Cancer Data: Handling Missing Values

## Objective
This task focuses on addressing the issue of missing values in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Different imputation techniques including mean/mode imputation, regression, and regression with perturbation are used.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt`
- **Statistical Techniques**: Mean/Mode Imputation, Regression Imputation, Regression with Perturbation
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Optional**: Comparison of classification models (e.g., SVM, KNN) built using the imputed data sets and the original data set.
