# Crime Rate Prediction using PCA and Regression

## Objective
This task involves using the crime data and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by regression to predict the crime rate in a city. The task aims to compare the quality of this new model to the older regression model and specify the new model in terms of original variables rather than principal components.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: `uscrime.txt`
- **Statistical Models**: Principal Component Analysis followed by Linear Regression
- **Programming Language**: R
