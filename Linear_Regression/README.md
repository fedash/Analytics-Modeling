# Crime Rate Prediction using Regression

## Objective
This task involves using crime data to build a regression model that predicts the crime rate in a city based on several predictors such as Median age, Education level, Police expenditure, Labor force, and more. The task also aims to assess the model's quality of fit and understand the degree of overfitting, given that the dataset is small.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: `uscrime.txt`
- **Statistical Models**: Linear Regression (`lm` or `glm` in R)
- **Programming Language**: R
