### 1. CUSUM Summer Temperature Analysis

  This project focuses on the analysis of summer temperatures in Atlanta using the CUSUM statistical test. It aims to identify when the unofficial summer ends and assess whether the climate has been warming.

---

### 2. Exponential Smoothing to Analyze End of Summer Trends

  Using Exponential Smoothing models, this project analyzes daily high-temperature data for Atlanta to ascertain if the end of the unofficial summer has been extending over the years.

### 3. Breast Cancer Data: Handling Missing Values

  This project addresses missing values in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using various imputation methods. It also compares different classification models like SVM and KNN.

---

### 4. Crime Rate Prediction using Regression

  A project that uses multiple linear regression to model and predict crime rates in U.S. cities based on various predictors like Median Age, Education level, and Police expenditure.

---

### 5. Crime Outlier Analysis

  Utilizing the Grubbs Test, this project aims to identify outliers in crime rates across U.S. cities.

---

### 6. Crime Rate Prediction using PCA and Regression

  This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by linear regression to predict crime rates in U.S. cities. It aims to compare the model quality against standard regression models.

---

### 7. Regression Tree and Risk Assessment Models

  A two-part project; the first part builds regression tree and random forest models using crime data, while the second part employs logistic regression for credit risk assessment using German credit data.

---

### 8. Advanced Regression Models for Crime Data

  This project focuses on advanced regression techniques like Stepwise Regression, Lasso, and Elastic Net for predicting crime rates.
